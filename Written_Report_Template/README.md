# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this data analysis was to use visualization tools in Excel, such as tables or charts, to help evaluate how campaign outcomes, launch dates, and funding goals differed
in the Kickstarter data.

## Analysis and Challenges

### The analysis was performed by creating a pivot table that captured the outcomes and launch dates for the subcategory theater. 
    The counts of the canceled, failed and successful theater campaign outcomes were then visualized in a line chart titled Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch under Resources.
    Next, an analysis of the outcomes based on goals were captured by set ranges from the minimum of $0 to the maximum of $50,000. See: Outcomes_vs_Goals under Resources.

### The challenge I encountered was the use of the COUNTIFS() function. I missed one of the criteria, which led to me getting the same numbers for each outcome column. 
    I overcame the challenge by reaching out to a TA for assistance. Then, I was able to finish the table needed to create the Outcomes_vs_Goals line chart.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
  1. The month of May had the highest successful theater campaigns. 
  2. The month of October had the most failed campaigns.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
  I can conclude that the goal range of $40,000 to $49,999 was the highest failed for plays. 
  Also, the campaign goal of less than $1,000 was the most successful.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
  Limitations of this dataset are the following:
	-Irrelevant data has not been deleted. 
	-The city was not included.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
  1. Stacked Bar Chart
  2. Scatter Chart
